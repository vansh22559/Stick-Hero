## Game Mechanics

1. **Stick-Hero Control:** Use keyboard input to stretch out a stick and bridge gaps between pillars.
   
2. **Multiple Pillars:** Navigate Stick-Hero through platforms of varying widths and heights.
   
3. **Reviving Feature:** Collect cherries to revive Stick-Hero once during gameplay. Cherries and related scores are deducted after revival.
   
4. **Timing is Crucial:** Time your stick extension carefully to land on the next platform. Failure results in Stick-Hero falling into the abyss, ending the game.
   
5. **Collect Rewards:** Flip Stick-Hero upside down to collect cherries and increase your score.
   
6. **Scoring System:** Aim for high scores by collecting rewards and challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard.
