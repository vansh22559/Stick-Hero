## Stick Hero Game

### Introduction
Welcome to Stick Hero, an exciting game inspired by the classic Stick Hero, developed using JavaFX and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project, part of the Advanced Programming course at IIIT Delhi, replicates the core mechanics of Stick Hero while incorporating innovative elements.

### Game Summary
Stick Hero is a platformer where players control the character Stick-Hero, who uses a stick to traverse between pillars. The objective is to collect cherries, reach the destination, and achieve the highest possible score. Embrace the challenge and enjoy the thrilling gameplay!

### Game Mechanics
- **Stick-Hero Control**: Use keyboard inputs to control Stick-Hero, who extends a stick to bridge gaps between pillars.
- **Multiple Pillars**: Guide Stick-Hero across platforms of varying widths.
- **Reviving Feature**: Collect cherries to revive Stick-Hero once during gameplay. Reviving deducts cherries and associated scores.
- **Timing is Crucial**: Extend the stick at the right moment to land on the next platform. Failing to do so results in Stick-Hero falling into the abyss, ending the game.
- **Collect Rewards**: Flip Stick-Hero upside down to collect cherries, boosting the player's score.
- **Scoring System**: Increase your score by collecting more rewards, and aim for the top spot on the leaderboard.
